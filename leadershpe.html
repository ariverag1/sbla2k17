<p>Gerardo obtained his Bachelor and Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles.
He now works as a Mechanical Engineer at Raytheon where he designs satellites for earth science research.
He decided to become a part of the board because as a first-generation college graduate, he received support from mentors throughout his journey in engineering school.
Now that he has graduated, he feels it is his turn to fill the shoes of a mentor and give back to his community.
The executive board at SBLA shares a common goal, to give back through volunteer services.</p>

Juan obtained his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University.
He now works as a Mechanical Engineer at Raytheon where he helps design and manufacture components for GPS avionics on fighter aircraft platforms.
This helps with positioning, navigation, and timing of tactical warfare for national security.
He decided to become a part of the board because he believes in the STEM pipeline and promoting STEM from K-12, college, and the professional level.
SHPE and MAES were there for him in college and he feels its his turn to give back. <br>

Miguel obtained his Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Irvine.
He now works as a Process Engineer at Chevron where he provides technical support for a running operation that makes gasoline and other fuel products to power our world.
He develops new ideas to improve safety, reliability, and optimization of the processes.
He decided to become a part of the board to actively identify opportunities for others and himself to give back to our communities.
He also joined to bridge the gap with our MAES counterparts, who have the same goals of empowering young Latino(a) students to reach their potential in STEM fields.
