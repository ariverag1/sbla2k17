	Gerardo obtained his Bachelor and Master of Science in mechanical engineering from the University of California, 
	Los Angeles (UCLA). He works as a mechanical engineer at Raytheon where he designs and tests satellites for earth 
	science research. He decided to become a member of the SHPE SBLA board because as a first-generation college 
	graduate, he received support from mentors throughout his journey in engineering school. 
	Now that he graduated, it’s his turn to fill the shoes of a mentor as many did before him. As a board member he 
	does everything he can to spread the SHPE mission; provide STEM awareness, access, support, and development to 
	empower the Hispanic community.
